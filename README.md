Neural Networks from Scratch ðŸ§ 
This repository is dedicated to building neural networks from the ground upâ€”no TensorFlow, no PyTorch, just pure Python (and maybe NumPy). The goal is to deeply understand how neural networks function under the hood by implementing everything manually.

ðŸ”¥ Features
Implementing core neural network components (layers, activations, loss functions, optimizers)
Forward and backward propagation explained and coded step by step
Training a basic neural network on simple datasets
Optimizations like batch processing, momentum, and learning rate adjustments
ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy (for matrix operations)
Matplotlib (for visualizations)

So as OpenAI released GPT-4.5, i decided to Start building Neural networks from scratch
